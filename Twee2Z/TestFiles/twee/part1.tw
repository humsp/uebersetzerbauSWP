You lunge forward, but even as you do the world fades away before your eyes, the brightness leaving a streak of light only in your mind. You're in an endless void, constantly stretching out into infinity.

And you are starting to suspect that you're blind. Pathetic, pathetic, pathetic. "And here I used to think it was you that had the strength. I... I've always been so damn wretched compared to you; you always knew what you wanted and how to get it. And you could always find ways to use me." You lay there for a long time, not worried, not in a hurry to go anywhere. "I realize now...

[[I really am weaker than you]]
[[That really, I'm stronger than you]]
