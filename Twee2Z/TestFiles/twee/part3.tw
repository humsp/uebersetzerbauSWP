:: Your heart quickens
This is mostly, though, because you suddenly realize that you are suspended above the ground. You dangle down, your arms pinned above your head. A dull throbbing ache from your arms reminds you of your position. 

He approaches you, meeting your gaze with steady, clear eyes. 

Again comes a pang of recognition; you feel like you could just shout out his name into the air! His face is emotionless as he stares into yours, creased with agony. 

So many questions for him run through your head. [[Who are you?]] [[Why are you doing this to me?]] [[Will you please take me down from the wall?]]



:: does not want this death
You decide to leave this all behind. Dropping the spikes to the floor, you hurry through the halls until you find the door to the outside. 

You almost welcome the embrace of the spectral beings as you flee. A life has been spared.

The world fades around you. And there //it// is, finally back once more.

[so this is the path you have chosen. the path of [[mercy]].]  



:: return the favor
You let your fingers tighten all the way, until his form breathes no more. You release his neck, eyeing the dark bruises starting to form. Of course what you did was right. It had to be done. 

The world fades around you. And there it is, finally back once more.

[so this is the path you have chosen. the path of [[violence]].] 



:: call him
You pick up the phone and dial the number on the card. Almost immediately, you hear a youngish voice answer. 

"Hello? This is Dr. Sun's office. Are you calling to make an appointment?"

"Um... well..." You wonder what exactly you're supposed to say. "I got this box from Dr. Sun... and I, uh, was supposed to call him... I mean, that's what the letter said..."

"Oh, you must be the high-priority patient Dr. Sun was talking about." There's a short pause. "Dr. Sun will be by tomorrow at noon. Does that work for you? Good. Thank you for calling. Goodbye." 

You stand there for a few seconds before hanging up the phone. So Sun would be there tomorrow at noon? You imagine the bliss, the sheer relief of having that thing gone from you forever. Of living a normal life, not plagued by that parasite. 

[aversion. distaste. anxiety.]
 
It pushes your mind with its dull, heavy presence. You shove it aside. It begins to push harder, trying to wrap around your mind, explore every weakness.

[hatred. fear. disgust. panic.]

You head begins to spin and swim; your vision blurs. You fall to the floor, trying to keep control, keep your head above the waves it threatens to drown you in.

[death. despair. anguish. ceasing.]

You grit your teeth, pushing your hands against your eyes. You've never felt it this strong before. It must have been saving its strength for this crushing blow.

[forfeit. release. relax. relinquish.]

Does it want to assume complete control? Your heart pounds faster, wondering what would happen if it really did take control, if you just [[let it take over completely]]. No, you tell yourself. You must [[fight it]]. 



:: fight it
You remain on the floor, a sharp piercing pain starting in your head. You wonder what it would seem like to someone if they walked in on you in this little episode. You almost want to laugh sardonically at this situation. Still, the pressure and pain wrench you back into your predicament. You lay in the floor for a while, every muscle tense and cramped. Once it knows it no longer has control it backs off slowly, receding until it's nothing more than a dull pressure on your mind. You let yourself relax, drained both physically and mentally. The pain in your head remains; you open your fingers clenched tight to see thick tufts of hair in them. You pat your head gingerly, wincing. You can only imagine what a mess you look like now. 

You force yourself to stand and look square in the mirror. Eyes red and rubbed, hair a bloody mess, with large bald patches. You wash the blood from your hands and plod slowly to your bed, collapsing on it in exhaustion. You don't think of anything except the escape of [[sleep]]. 



:: retreat
Prudent as ever, you tuck your weapon into your belt. 

Immediately your senses are on guard once more. You are mesmerized for a moment by a flicker of movement in the fog, but you tear your mind from those thoughts. 

What matters is safety. 

You once again notice the moldy dumpster by your side. You could always [[clamber inside and hide]].

Then again, you're pretty sure he is coming right this way. Perhaps it would be better to summon the courage to [[enter the fog]]. 



:: That really, I'm stronger than you
"I've always been stronger than you and you know it. Any envy I used to hold was the deluded mistake of a child. Now I understand. You've really wanted to have my role this whole time. For all your show you always knew I was the one in charge. And you must have hated me for it, seeing me day after day existing more powerful than you even though you felt it should never be so. In the end, you always [[envied my existence|awaken]]" 


:: Concentrate on the sound of my voice
You try. You try very hard to keep your mind latched on the sound. Sun is still talking but you cannot make out the words anymore, just sounds that wash over you like warms rays of sunlight. //Perhaps that's why he has the name Sun...// You smile blithely, despite the ever increasing pain. His voice becomes stronger, parts cutting through the pain. "I need... put... state of... in your mind... Ready? ...Three, two, one..."

Everything becomes [[blackness]].



:: cave2
You've only been in a cave one other time in your life. You were still very young then, and your parent had taken you to the caves for your birthday. You had been so afraid of the dark then. You feared every shadow in that cave. You were so relieved when it was over and you could see the reassuring light of day again. Of course you didn't tell your parent that; you merely smiled and said it was fun. 

[[<<Back|cave]]


:: You're itching to tear something apart, to smash it to pieces.
And it feels so good to be thinking these thoughts independently, to know they aren't being caused by an invisible being forcing your hand but purely by your burning, fervent passion. 

[[<<Back|it doesn't make any sense at all]]



:: weapon
You walk up to a sizeable stalagmite, swiftly breaking it from the cave floor. It's the perfect size for a decent weapon. You swing it through the air a few times, slashing down imaginary foes. 

[quite the violent one, aren't you?]

You're so used to its presence that it you don't even pause in your swinging of the stalagmite. But this time it's not inside of you, it's somewhere else. And although it's communication with you is different this time... more //sophisticated//... it still feels like an emotion, compelling you to act, triggering the basest of instincts. But its pull isn't very strong, and you can easily ignore its voice. 

[do you plan on doing any killing? you don't even know if anyone else exists here besides you. and yet you still arm yourself like the barbarian you are.]



[[Well I know you're here. And you'll be the first I kill.]]
[[It's better safe than sorry, you know.]]
[[Just go away. I'm busy.]]



:: enter the fog
You hold your breath and dash into the fog. In an instant your clothes are soaked and you are chilled to the bone. You can see glimpses of faces, of ever-changing bodies reaching out towards you… you dash them away as best you can, wishing only for the swirling whiteness around you to end. 

And there it is! Just ahead of you, the air seems darker. Although the specters provide no resistance, it feels as if you have to pry your way from them with all your strength. 

Finally you emerge, gasping, from the clammy mist. 

Ahead of you stands a dark building, tall and majestic. It looks like it used to be a barn, but you see it as a shelter. It could be a vast [[war fortress]] from which you could wage mighty battles. Or it could be the perfect [[safehouse]], a refuge form the tyrants of the outside world.  



:: lash out at it
"You're a liar! You treat me like an idiot, lie to my face, and all for what!" You try to walk, but realize you're lying on the ground. You try to crawl but your limbs feel like they're made of lead. "If you're really my 'nature' then what is it that makes me wish you were dead and gone? You going to say I have no nature now? You going to treat me like a broken machine? If it's control you want, you're not getting it! Not ever!"

[you could never understand my motivation. you're so far below me. my dreams. they are so much more than you could ever imagine.]

Every muscle in your body strains to move. But you can't help but let your eyelids slip closed. 

You wonder if you'll ever [[awaken]]. 



:: war fortress
You don’t know how long you spend at your shelter. But slowly the wooden walls morph into stone and mortar, the hay underfoot becoming polished marble. Your palace grows and expands as your thirst for battle grows in your heart. 
For the strong, war is the only option. And for the weak – well, they were only those crushed by those who truly held power.

It made perfect sense now, the fact that only the strongest could prevail. Why, constant war became a staple of life. Was that not natural, [[how existence was meant to be]]?

Every day your eye is drawn more and more to the ethereal vapors that encircle your small fortress. With each passing minute they seem to draw closer, encroaching on your territory. You wonder if you should try to [[study more about them]], try to figure them out. Then again, even looking at them gives you a bad feeling. You wonder if you should just [[leave them alone|a good deal of time]].
