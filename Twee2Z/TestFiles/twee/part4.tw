:: ring
...when the sharp ring of the doorbell startles you out of your relaxation. You feel a cold sweat run down your back as you extract yourself from your sheets. Standing in front of your door, your mind is a panic. You've never gotten a visitor before. Again, the ring of the doorbell. You wonder if you should [[open it]] or [[leave it locked]]. 


:: hear
You concentrate your entire being on your hearing. And with a burst of energy, you clear your ears and let them fill with the sound around you. You can hear water; the sounds surround you, echoing in your head.

:: It's better safe than sorry, you know.
[a ridiculous saying that paranoids use all too often.]
You scowl, irritated now. "Well then let's say I left this cave right now and was attacked, and the only reason I survived was because I had myself a weapon?"
[well what about if you left the cave now and were attacked and killed because you looked murderous and threatening, holding a big, pointy stalagmite in your hands?]
"That's not how it works," you mutter to yourself, trying not to admit that it's got a valid point.

:: how existence was meant to be
You remember reading somewhere, “I put for the general inclination of all mankind, a perpetual and restless desire of power after power, that ceaseth only in death.” 

Ah yes, that was The Leviathan by Thomas Hobbes.

In your mind this has some kind of significance, but you can’t quite figure out what.

:: Why are you doing this to me?
At this question his eyes light up with life. "Why? Why am I doing this?" He waves his arms to the walls around him. "You may as well ask why this very building stands here! It is all a [[symbol]], a testimony to the strong!" These last works he shouts out to echo through every crack and crevice in the stones around you. "What you do not seem to understand is the role of the weak and the strong in this world. Some are born for greatness and violence is within their souls. This existence surges through my veins. Why else would any of this be happening?" He lets out a laugh. 

"But what--"

"Hush! You are naught but a specter, the ghost of the foolhardy. Your job is not to speak, but to suffer." His eyes glitter in the half-light of the room. "You chose the path of violence, did you not? 
"I'm leaving for the moment, but don't worry; I shall [[return]] soon enough."

With that he turns on his heel and his steps fade away into the distance.



:: see
You concentrate your entire being on your sense of sight. And with a burst of energy, you open your eyes and take in the world around you. The world is a blend of colors, blues and greens melding into grays and blacks. Shadows and light surround you, spinning like a kaleidoscope around you. After a few seconds of dizzying blinking, your sight seems to settle.

:: extending a hand
You take the proffered hand in yours, shaking it weakly. "Please, come [[inside|newinside]]." 


:: newinside
The two of you step inside. "Don't mind the sheets... I'm, uh, doing laundry today," you mutter.

Looking around the house, you wonder what it must look like to this stranger's eyes. Although the house is big, most of it is barely touched. Unable to stand the isolation of sleeping in a bedroom, you'd long ago moved your bed out to the living room.
Soon other things moved to sit around your bed: a mini-fridge, an old TV you'd fished out of the dump, any life possessions that really mattered. Eventually you just lived out in the living room, leaving the rest of the house to rot. It all seemed perfectly normal to you. But to this Henry Sun, you must look like a crazy person. 

You drag a chair from the disused kitchen and ask the doctor to sit. He does, still surveying the mess about him. You sit on your bed, across from him, and bounce up and down nervously like you did when you were [[little]].



:: lie about your problems
"No, actually... my problems are pretty much solved... really nothing to worry about..." You feel like you're talking far too fast. "Please, I'm perfectly fine. I just need to be left alone." 

"Is that what you want to say? Or is that just what it wants you to say?" His eyes glint with something. "If everything was fine, why did you call to make an appointment? I can't help you until I know the real source of your problems."

[agitation. resentment. withdrawal. escape.]

"No! Please, just get out of my house! I want you to leave!" You squeeze your eyes shut. The more you give in to it, the stronger you can feel it become. But you know if you try to fight it there will be pain, worse than ever before. Already you can feel a tension in your mind.

"Listen to me carefully. There is nothing I can do for you unless you let me help you. Now the first thing I need you to do is regain control of your emotions. Everything that is going on, any pain you are experiencing... it's all in your mind. You have to overcome it. [[Concentrate on the sound of my voice]]."



:: Ding dong
You open your eyes and leap from your bed in one swift, uncoordinated movement. Scrambling to your feet, you try to assess the situation. The doorbell is ringing with a persistent "ding dong". You're still wearing the clothes you had on yesterday, a bit ruffled but relatively clean. Unfortunately your pillow and sheets have dry patches of blood on them, probably from your scalp coming into contact. You rip the sheets from your bed and pile them in a corner, glance at the clock to see it's already 12:30 PM, and open the door hastily. 

A man in a suit carrying a slim briefcase stands in front of you. You can see a flash of worry, and something else - fear? - cross his face, but in an instant he is smiling widely and [[extending a hand]]. "Hello, I'm [[Henry Sun]]. You spoke to my secretary earlier. I'm here to try and [[help you with your problems]]."



:: The life which you envy so much
[what--]

And then it was silent. No presence, no pressure on your mind. Just total blankness. For a second your mind squirms, trying to figure out what to do with this sudden void in your thoughts. But you quickly suppress this. You must not show weakness. 

"It's. ah. It's the only answer! Why else would you seek to control me, throw me around, try to convince me that my life is not worth living? What goal could you possibly have set your sights on?" You pause, your eyes narrowing in anger. "Was I right in what I said earlier? Do you seek to become me, to steal everything from me? Is that it?
"Well I think that everything you've put me through, even this very room, shows that [[you don't know me at all]]!" 



:: you don't know me at all
Your eyes are bright. "And to think, you lived with me all this time and you still don't understand who I am. And you still want to take what I have away from me; [[claim I don't deserve any of it]]? How... how dare you!" 

It is still silent. What is it waiting for?

"It's always this way! This is just..." You continue on your tirade, feeling [[panic]] begin to prick the edge of your thoughts. 

Was it the time for concern? Could you possibly afford doubt? Or was it [[time to act]]?



:: panic
As much as you want to continue to protest it, you decide to pay heed to your doubt. After all, it is your doubt that you've always clung to. It seemed like it was the one possessed by action; you were the one to pause and take stock of the casualties. But now you were completely in control and perhaps you could stop everything now--

[ah, I finally see the problem here. you think me powerless.]

You find yourself struck with a sudden terror. This is just irrational, you tell yourself. The remnants of childhood instinct. 

[what you have to remember is that [[this is my world]]. and I am free to do as I please.]

Half of you wants to [[stand up to it|time to act]], the other half wants to [[run away as far as possible]]. 

All that you hope is that you may be rational.

The Abyss
A story of within and without.

:: run away as far as possible
You dash out of the room, breathing shallow. You don't have to see it; you know it has materialized where you once stood. You weave through the halls of the house, trying to find the front door, but nothing is where you remember it anymore. Everything is dark and shadowy, looming out at you. 

And behind you come the heavy footsteps of //it//, slow and steady. You can hear a metallic scraping on the ground. 

It is going to kill you. 

You pull open the first door you see. It's a small linen closet. Desperately you cram yourself inside of it and close the door as best you can.

"So you acknowledge it then, you coward?" Its voice echoes through the house. "That I am the one truly in charge of this world?"

You try to hold your breath. Its footsteps draw ever closer.
"You don't know how joyful that acknowledgement makes me. I am the god of this world!" 

The footsteps stop.

The door creaks open.

"...and soon, I will be the god of yours." 

A blinding light, a flash of gold, and [[everything grows dark|end4]].
