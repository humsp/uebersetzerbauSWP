:: sequel
Although a sequel is not immediately being penned, I did very much enjoy this project and could very well come back to write up a sequel. 

It would go something like this:

Dispassionate. Yes, it was that one work that they all used to describe me. What a stunningly specific word. And yet this demonstrated their total and complete accuracy in this matter, for I was just that. Dispassionate. 

It was strange having my dreams so empty. Before they were full of life and energy, a presence that both frightened and thrilled me, filling me, daring me to look over the ledge, to leap if I so wished.  But that too was gone. 

There it is, right in front of me. A breeze blows through my hair and I lean over the edge to look down below. I stare down, down into that abyss that I had once traversed. Perhaps //it// is still down there, even to this day. The breeze pulls me closer to the edge, on the verge of falling into that abyss—

But those days are over. I cannot return to the abyss, even if I wished to. Even if I longed to with all my heart. 

Leaving all that behind was the price I had to pay to separate myself from it. 

And this is what my dream world is now.

:: consequences
[what you don't seem to understand is that all actions have consequences.]

You wait for it to continue.

[even your choice to get a weapon has drastic consequences. you cannot expect to live a life of peace now... violence breeds violence, you know...]

"Wait... what do you--"

The world around you changes, morphs into something else. The blues and greens around you melt away, replaced by dull tans and grays. The dark ceiling overhead twists and swirls, maroon and crimson spreading across its entirety. Soon you're standing in a [[different world]]. 



:: Try to question it instead.
"So you say this is all in my head, eh?" You grin. "Well prove it!" You feel proud, asking this. 

"Any ordinary person would have understood this by now. But not you. You require proof. More proof than you've already been given, something tangible, something you can analyze, deconstruct, reconstruct in a new fashion to suit your tastes. You want in-your-face, incontrovertible proof that you're insane. You cannot make the simple step in logic, and so you must beg of others the knowledge which you so sorely lack."

"Hey wait, that's not what--"

A long moment of silence passes. You can feel your neck begin to cramp but you don't dare raise your head. Instead the simplest [[question]] comes to mind, the one you've been asking yourself [[your whole life]]. 



:: stay home
You pull the covers over your head. It's better not to go anywhere. You've gotten around all of your life being alone. You're not about to change now. You nestle in the warmth of your blankets and feel yourself begin to drift into a light sleep....

[[Next>>|ring]]



:: Oh. I'm sorry to hear that. Now I, um, really must be going.
You stand hurriedly, your chair scraping against the ground with a screech. You can tell Alex is disappointed as you hurry back to the safety of your [[home|newhome]].


:: question
"Who are you?" Although your head is lowered, your voice is defiant. "Give me your real answer this time."

"Who am I?" There's its voice again. It doesn't sound old or young, or particularly like anything for that matter. If you could choose one word to describe it, it would be.... curious. "Is this the first time you've realized that that should be the first question you should have asked me? Of course if you had an ounce of intelligence you would know who I am." It pauses, clearly expecting some reaction. "Perhaps we even could have even... coexisted." Is that remorse you hear? You shake your head. It couldn't be. 

"Just answer the question. I've had enough of your riddles." Your voice is soft but you have no doubt that it will obey you.

"Very well, if you must know... But it's really not that simple. Ah, how to explain this? Well let me begin with a question then: Who are you?"

"What do you mean?" Despite the smoke and burning incense stuffing the room you feel intensely cold. "I'm just... me. Nothing more, nothing less."

"Wrong. Funny that you could even screw that answer up. Well perhaps not wrong, but certainly not right. You are the product of societal pressures combined with the teachings of your parents to create an object, a tool, that others can use in order to maintain the functions of the society. Or that was the intention anyway. I see you still don't understand. To put it simply, you are [[Nurture]]."



:: Nurture
"Nurture?" Dread spreads through your whole being. "Then... then what are..."

"You haven't figured it out yet? Well perhaps I should spell it out for you. I am Nature, the innate, the indestructible. I am the part of everyone that they either cherish or despise, the unavoidable characteristic that shapes all, no matter how hard they try to avoid it. I am the truth behind the layers of dependence and falsity that people put around themselves, the ultimate longings and desires they harbor, even as they smile and pretend to content themselves with the trivialities built up by society." 

"But... but that means..."

"That means that I am you. Perhaps I am more 'you' than even you are." 

In a way [[this makes sense]], but then again [[it doesn't make any sense at all]]. 




:: symbol
Or perhaps more like an extended metaphor, representing nothing much in particular? You often found that looking for symbolism in something was merely stuffing your own opinion into a work. This was probably one of those times. 

[[<<Back|Why are you doing this to me?]]


:: it doesn't make any sense at all
You squeeze your eyes shut. You wish that your chaotic thoughts would just still themselves. "That. That can't be."
 
"The world is made up of either truth or fiction. Do you really think that everything I've just told you is a lie?"

You put one hand against your forehead; it feels as if you're running a fever. "It's... it's just that..."

"Speechless as you usually are. You've never known how to act or what to think without someone else telling you what to do. It's because you've never been more than a sum of others' ideas; you've always strived for power but have been unable to change anything of your own. That is why--"

"Stop! Just... just stop!" And surprisingly, it does. "This doesn't make sense! None of it does! Like... who has ever heard of someone's nature and nurture being separated... and conflicting with each other? It's just... just not possible. And you're speaking in a bunch of abstract jargon to try and excuse it."

"Attempting to use rationality to define something so complex--"

"Didn't I tell you to stop?" You grin now, feeling a bit dizzy with power. "You always thought you had all the power, you always thought you were stronger than me, but you always knew you could never defeat me, never overcome me, no matter how hard you tried. But you still tried to control me, tried to isolate me, you did a hell of a good job at that... and all for what!?" You're angry, bitter, demanding... and you're feeling a bit violet as well. [[You're itching to tear something apart, to smash it to pieces.]]  "So what is it you want, eh? [[Why have you been DOING this to me?]]"



:: end2
Emptiness.

‘Hello?’

[hello.]

Light around you. The harshness of the artificial light stuns you for a second.

“Hello? How are you?” Henry Sun peers at you. You realize he’s standing above you. Your instinct tells you you’re lying in a hospital bed.

‘I’m fine.’ [I’m well.]

“What?” Confusion flashes across his face. “Are you…”

[why are you concerned?] ‘What’s wrong with me?’

“It’s like you’re talking… with two voices…”

[ah.] ‘I see.’

So things were like before. Once again this vying for power would absorb your life, your very being. 

[the cycle is never broken. it starts again and again.]

[[the end]]
